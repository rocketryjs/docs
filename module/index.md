# Module - `index.js`
This module contains a constructor function and many helper functions for getting MIDI devices. The function is used at the root of the module when required as a constructor that automatically picks supported devices and their corresponding classes. This method of construction is not required, just easy to use. You can supply `new rocketry()` with port numbers to use if you know them or omit them for it to detect the first supported pair.
