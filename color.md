# Color
The older devices — Launchpad S, Launchpad Mini — only support bi-color while the newer devices — Launchpad MK2, Launchpad Pro — support RGB colors and not bi-color. Here I outline the differences and explain what that means for interacting with your device. Examples for using these colors can be found in [Interaction](interaction.md).

## Bi-color
The Launchpads that don't support RGB colors — Launchpad Mini, Launchpad S — support the changing of brightness for two LEDs — red and green — per button. The range of each brightness value is 0 - 3 (inclusive). Combining these brightnesses you can create colors of the hues of amber and yellow. All possible colors are [named](#named-bi-color) for ease of use.

## RGB
The Launchpads that support RGB colors — Launchpad MK2, Launchpad Pro — support the changing of brightness for three LEDs — red, green, and blue — per button. The RGB color support is divided between "standard" colors and "full" RGB colors. I make this distinction because full RGB colors can't be used in many places that expect a standard color as a limitation of the available MIDI commands. These colors have [default names](#named-rgb) and can be [named by the user](#custom-names).

### Standard RGB
The 128 standard colors are a single digit can be used anywhere that requires a color. Using these over a full RGB color is typically faster because some methods use a single MIDI command with a static value instead of possibly more expensive operations.

Here are the colors 0 - 63 then 64 - 127 (inclusive). This image should match the terrible graphic from Novation's programmer's reference but the actual colors corrected from a RAW image and not their murky and exaggerated ones.

### Full RGB
If you need more options and using a method that supports full RGB, you have full control over the separate red, green, and blue channels. Sadly the range of each brightness value is 0 - 63 (inclusive). You can't use RGB for most methods and you're only guaranteed support with lighting and using them may be slightly slower than using a standard color.

## Named Colors

### Default
Using those images, counting, using a table, and doing mental math is pretty tedious; so I added some default names that you can use in place of standard, RGB, or bi-color values. You should notice that black is actually off and there are a few other aliases.

#### Named RGB

### Custom Names
You can add or replace the color names for a specific device class by modifying `launchpad.constructor.color.names`, an object with names and values as key-value pairs.
##### Example
```js
// Replace the default color names with yours for all devices of the same class
launchpad.constructor.color.names = {
	"fabulous": 57,
	"alias": "fabulous",
	"a cool rgb color": {
		"red": 10,
		"green": 20,
		"blue": 30
	}
};

// Add color "flashy"
launchpad.constructor.color.names.flashy = 1;

// Use them as you'd use a default color name
launchpad.light("fabulous");
button.flash("flashy");
```
